**Chat History Summary:**

German customer ordered RAM (€282.74). Amazon cancelled due to payment issue. Support told him to reorder; item unavailable. Support explicitly promised price difference refund if he ordered similar item (€1,080) - this was "internally approved." He complied. After delivery, Amazon refuses refund.

**Update 25.01.2026:**
Amazon sent a "final decision" email rejecting the claim based on:

1.  Cancelled original order (no contract).
2.  Marketplace seller (ALX-Trade) vs. Amazon Global Store.
3.  Lack of authority for support agents.
4.  Offer: Return item for full refund (rejected by user).

**Legal Situation in Germany - Key Pointers:**

**1. Binding Nature of Support Promise:**

- Under BGB §§145, 241, verbal agreements are binding when offer, acceptance, consideration, and legal intention exist
- Support's explicit promise creates a **vertragliche Nebenabrede** (ancillary agreement) independent of main purchase contract
- **Rechtsscheinsvollmacht (apparent authority):** Amazon is bound by its employees' declarations; customer reasonably relied on Amazon's authority

**2. Marketplace Argument Fails:**

- Amazon's internal policy doesn't override binding contract law
- The promise was made _by Amazon_, _to the customer_, _in Amazon's name_ - origin of product is irrelevant to this separate obligation

**3. Insurance Deductible Issue:**

- €1,500 SB > €700 claim = insurance effectively useless
- Self-representation (Amtsgericht) is economical: court fees ~36-40 EUR (Streitwert up to €1,000)
- Loser-pays principle: if he wins, Amazon pays costs

**4. Recommended Action Path (Updated):**

- **Step 1:** Users sent formal demand (deadline 01.02.2026).
- **Step 2:** Amazon rejected ("End of discussion").
- **Step 3 (Now):** Wait until deadline expires.
- **Step 4:** **Judicial Dunning Process (Gerichtliches Mahnverfahren)** via `online-mahnantrag.de`.
    - Cost: ~36 EUR.
    - High success probability as Amazon often settles to avoid court costs for small amounts/clear evidence.

**5. Key Evidence:**

- Chat transcripts/emails showing explicit promise ("You will get the same offer as promised")
- Rejection email serves as proof of refusal to pay (Verweigerung).
